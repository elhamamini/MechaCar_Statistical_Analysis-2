- Multi-linear regression model based on data representing 50 samples of 6 variables. Found significant correlation of vehicle length and ground clearance to effect MPG. There is a minor correlation to MPG with vehicle weight as well, however it does not as fall within standard tolerance.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
  - What metric or metrics are you going to test?
  - What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
  - What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
  - What data is needed to run the statistical test?
  
The statistical study design has the following:
A metric to be tested is mentioned (5 pt)
A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described (5 pt)
A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis (5 pt)
The data for the statistical test is described (5 pt)
